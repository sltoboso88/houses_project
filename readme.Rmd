# MEDIAN HOUSES VALUE WEST COAST USA

## What is the data set about?  

This data set is a fictional and is about the median house value in diferrent areas around the West Coast in USA. This data set came from a csv file and had 20640 rows and 10 columns. Those columns are:  

- Latitude  
- Longitude  
- Households age  
- Total rooms  
- Total bedrooms  
- Population  
- Households  
- Median house income  
- Median house value  
- Ocean proximity  

## Tools used in this project  

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - dfply  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - pandas_profiling  
  - seaborn  
  - plotnine  
  - statsmodel  
  - matplotlib  
  - sklearn  
  - scipy

## Clean Process  

- **Values Validation**: Some columns had some invalid values, for instance longitude had -1.000000e+18 as value, so we drop all the not valid values. Also other columns had valid values but followed by special characters as *?*, so we had removed those specials characters.  

- **Outliers**: The columns total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households, median_house_income and median_house_value had outliers, in this case because we had enough data, we just drop them.  

- **Missing Values**: The column total_bedroom had 180 missing values, for filling them we found the mean of population per bedrooms (3), and the mean of population per rooms (5). For filling each missing value we made a ration between population per bedroom and rooms in each row.  

- **Cross validation**: In this case we only did one cross validation around the number of people per bedroom. In the west coast of USA the maximum number of people allow to live in a rent bedroom are 2, the mean of population per bedroom was 3, so we decide to drop all the rows with more than 6 persons per bedroom.  

## Some useful plots from the data set:  

- The median_house_value, change a lot according to ocean_proximity. The median_house_value in land is the lowest and the median_house_value is the highest in the islands.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ocean_proximity_house_value.png")
```

- The median_house_income change a lot between the house inland and the houses closer to the ocean or beach. But here is particulary interesting see how the median income in the houses located in the islands are very low even when they have the most expensive houses. The reason for this could be that in the island most of the population are retired and probably the normal income that they have isn't very high.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ocean_proximity_median_income.png")
```

## Model  

In this case we decided to do a linear model, for this we standardize all the variables so the comparation was easier. In the first moment we only used the features than looked more relative with the median_houses_value, as:  

- median_income  
- ocean_proximity  
- households_median_age  
- total_rooms  

In the end we couldn't find a very good model with only those features, so we decided to do a model with all the features, but even with this we couldn't find a very good model with a good fit and spred residuals.  

For the future we should try other model with the purpose of find a way to predict the median house value.
